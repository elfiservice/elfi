# elfi BUDGETING WEB SYSTEM
Due to my company's need to manage budgets and your clients, following from the moment of the creation of the budget, the accompaniment to the client for approval.

When approved, maintaining a history throughout this process until the moment of the conclusion of the service still doing a follow-up after-sale.

With that I was able to create a whole database to generate reports of my clients.

This project was originally started in 2011 with PHP and MySQL, initially not object-oriented nor in an MVC organization.
Today I have practically refactored the entire system using OO and MVC.

This was an incredible experience where it evolved quite a bit on both the Front-end and the Back-end.
